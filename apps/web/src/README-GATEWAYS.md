# Gateways + Test Mode

This app centralizes all client/server data access behind small gateway modules in `src/lib/data/*`.

- Each domain exposes a `<Domain>Gateway` type and factories:
  - `createHttpGateway()` – production HTTP implementation
  - `createTestGateway()` – test-mode implementation
  - `create<Domain>Gateway()` – picks test or http based on `isTestMode()`
- Gateways validate data using Zod schemas from `@education/shared` and normalize minor differences to reduce UI conditionals.

## Test Mode
- Enabled by `TEST_MODE=1` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_TEST_MODE=1`.
- Server routes and gateways return deterministic seedable data without a database.
- Role can be switched via `/api/test/switch-role` or the header switcher in layout.

## Seed & Switch
- Seed demo data: click "Seed" in the header (labs), or call `/api/test/seed?hard=1`.
- Switch role: use the header selector or POST to `/api/test/switch-role` with `role`.

## Adding a Gateway
1. Create `src/lib/data/<domain>.ts` with gateway type and the three factories.
2. Parse responses with Zod, and throw via a centralized error helper when `{ error, requestId }` is returned.
3. Re-export the `create<Domain>Gateway` and type from `src/lib/data/index.ts`.
4. Update pages to import from the barrel.

## Deprecated
- Direct `fetch`/`serverFetch` calls from pages. Prefer gateways for domain I/O.

## Implemented domains (selection)

- courses, lessons, modules, assignments, submissions, quizzes
- messages, notifications, files, reports, profiles, dashboard, progress, grading
- announcements, parentLinks, providers
- registry, runtime (interactive)
- users, flags, events, health

System labs that previously read `/api/health` directly have been migrated to use `createHealthGateway()` where sensible (pages that need response headers for observability, like `request-id`, still use `serverFetch` to read headers but do not parse body ad‑hoc).
